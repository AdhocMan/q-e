There has been a few change of the indabs.f90 for calculating indirect optical properties: 
1. From line 252-259, the velocity matrix element had a false factor of 0.5, casuing wrong factor of 0.25 in the spectra. This is not fixed. 
2. From line 389-392, two new variables are added: cufkkd and cufkqd. 
3. Corresponding to (2), From line 445-448, the rotation matrices are modified from cufkk/cufkq to cufkkd/cufkqd. 
4. Line 233, a minus sign is added before degaussw


(2) and (3) are done since we use finite difference to generate the correction of VME's when QP eigenvalues are read. 
For this purpose, a slightly shifted grid is used to generate the eigenvalues to use for the finite difference. 
The original usage of cufkk and cufkq, and the reuse of these rotation matrices later on caused a problem that
the VME's generated later used this wrong rotation matrix on the shifted grid.

(4) is done since this line tells the code to exclude transitions that are larger than (6*degaussw) above maximum frequency, 
and smaller than (6*degaussw) below the minimum frequency. This is to account for the fact that gaussian tails 
can also contribute to the transitions. Originally, the minus sign in the lower limit is missing, causing the code to exclude
transitions (6*degaussw) ABOVE the minimum frequency, not BELOW, and this causes problems for free carrier absorption/metals, etc.
