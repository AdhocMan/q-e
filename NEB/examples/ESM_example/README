This example shows how to calculate the minimum energy path (MEP)
by using the nudged elastic band (NEB) method in conjunction with
the Effective Screening Medium Method (ESM) and a constant bias potential
methods (FCP).

Before starting this example, see also examples for the ESM method and
a constant bias potential methods (FCP) in pw.x
(PW/examples/ESM_example).

The example calculations are divided into the following two parts,
1) NEB example for ESM calculation (run_example_ESM)
2) NEB example for FCP calculation (run_example_FCP)

The 'run_example' file executes the above two calculations.

1) NEB example for ESM calculation (run_example_ESM)
1-1) make a NEB calculation for H atom diffusion on Al(001) surface with
     ordinaly periodic boundary condition (no ESM),
     (input=Al001+H_pbc.in, output=Al001+H_pbc.out). This calculation
     shows the MEP of H atom (Bridge site -> top site -> bridge site).
     This is a reference calculation for the following ESM calculations.
1-2) make an NEB calculation for H atom diffusion on Al(001) surface with
     ESM (bc3),
     (input=Al001+H_bc3.in, output=Al001+H_bc3.out).

2) NEB example for FCP calculation (run_example_FCP)
2-1) repeat #1-2 under a constant bias potential condition using FCP.
     The target Fermi energy is set to that for the initial geometory
     of #1-2 system. This Fermi energy is the reference of the bias potential.
     (input=Al001+H_FCP_v00.in, output=Al001+H_FCP_v00.out).
2-2) repeat #2-1 but with a lower target Fermi energy (-0.5V)
     (input=Al001+H_FCP_vm05.in, output=Al001+H_FCP_vm05.out).
2-3) repeat #2-1 but with a higher target Fermi energy (+0.5V)
     (input=Al001+H_FCP_vp05.in, output=Al001+H_FCP_vp05.out).
